This is the second gallery project I've made using React, but in this one we're going to consume an API to collect the data. Enjoy :)

## My process

### Built with

- API : REST Countries API 
- SCSS 
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This is the second gallery project I've done using react, but this time the data used was pulled from an API (REST Countries API ). I was able to deepen my skills in React.

Check out some code: 



```js
import React from "react";
import style from "./Cards.module.scss";

const Cards = ({ cards }) => {
  return (
    <div className={style.container}>
      <div className={style.countries__cards}>
        {cards.map((card) => (
          <li key={card.name.common} className={style.countries__card}>
            <img
              src={card.flags.png}
              alt={card.flags.alt}
              className={style.countries__img}
            />
            <p className={style.countries__name}> {card.name.common}</p>
            <p className={style.countries__data}>
              <strong>Language:</strong>{" "}
              {Object.keys(card.languages).map((key) => card.languages[key]).join(", ")}
            </p>
            <p className={style.countries__data}>
              <strong>Capital:</strong> {card.capital}
            </p>
            <p className={style.countries__data}>
              <strong>Region: </strong>
              {card.region}
            </p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Cards;


```


### Continued development

I will continue studying React library

### Useful resources

- [React JS](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) - The library contains great documents and tutorials.
